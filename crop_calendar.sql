Irregular to round spots brown in colour with chlorotic halos, appear on leaves, and later spread to stem. \r\nStem may break, pods are also infected leading to shrivelled seeds.\r\n• Control Measures : i) Grow resistant varieties; ii) Use healthy and disease free seeds ; iii) In case of severe infection, crop may be sprayed with 0.2 % (2g/liter) copper oxychloride (Blitox).\r\n2. Cowpea Mosaic\r\n• Symptoms : It is caused by a virus transmitted by aphids. \r\nThe affected leaves become pale yellow and exhibit mosaic, vein banding symptoms. The affected leaves become reduced in size and show puckering. Pods are also reduced and become twisted.\r\n• Control Measures : i) Use healthy seed from healthy crop ; \r\nii) For controlling aphids spray Oxydemeton methyl 25 EC (Metasystox) @ 1 ml/liter or Imidacloprid 17. 8 SL @ 0. 2 ml/ liter of water and repeat the spray after 10 days of first spray.\r\n3. Powdery mildew\r\n• Symptoms : Powdery mildew are visible on all the aerial parts of the affected plants. Symptoms first start from leaves and then spread to stem, branches and pods. \r\nThis white growth consists of the fungus and its spores. Affected leaves become twisted and smaller in size.\r\n• Control Measures :  i) After harvest, collect the plants left in the field and burn them; ii) The disease can be controlled by spray of wettable sulphur @ 3g/liter or carbendazim @1 g/liter of water\r\nPests\r\n1. Cowpea pod borer\r\n• Nature of Damage : The caterpillar rolls the leaves and web these with the top shoot. Caterpillar bore into the pods and feed on the seeds, if flower and pods are not available larvae feed on foliage.\r\n• Control Measures : i) Collect and destroy the eggs and young larvae; \r\nii) The young caterpillar can be killed by dusting 2% methyl parathion @ 25 - 30 kg p er hectare or spray of quinalphos @2 ml/liter of water;\r\n iii) Fix 3 feet stick in the field @10/ha bird parches to attract predatory birds.\r\n2. Hairy caterpillar\r\n• Nature of damage: It is major insect of cowpea. It is cut juvenile plants and eat away all the green matter of the leaves.\r\n• Control Measures : i) Collect and burn the eggs and burn the eggs and larva of insect ; ii) The young caterpillar can be control by spray of Chloropyriphos or Quinolphos @ 2ml/liter of water.\r\n3. Aphids and Jassids\r\n• Nature of Damage : The adult and nymphs of these pests suck the juice from the leaves and the damage is more severe when the plants are young. \r\nAs a result of sucking of sap, the leaves turn brown and crumbled and the plant look sick.\r\n• Control Measures : i) Spray of Oxydemeton Methyl 25 EC (Metasystox) @ 1 ml/ liter or Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7 ml/ liter of water', 'Harvesting\r\n\r\nGreen pods for use as vegetable can be harvested 45 - 90 days after sowing depending on the variety. \r\n\r\nFor grains, the crop can be harvested in about 90-125 days after sowing when pods are fully matured. The crop should be then dried and threshed , \r\nthreshed grain should be dried in sun before storage. For fodder, the cutting of the crop depends upon the need and the stage of growth of the component crop sown with it. \r\nGenerally it should be done 40 - 45 days after sowing.\r\nYield:\r\nA good crop of cowpea yields about 12 - 15 q of grain and 50 - 60 q of straw per hectare. If the crop is raised for fodder purpose 250 - 350 q of green fodder is obtained per hectare.', NULL, NULL),
(3, 'Jowar', 'Land Preparation:\r\nDeep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is harvested and leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice. \r\nWith the onset of monsoon the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross plankings. \r\nIf desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be well distributed throughout the field.\r\n', 'Sowing:\r\na) Sowing time:Sorghum crop is grown in almost all the seasons of the year. \r\nIn Northern India conditions it is grown in kharif season but in Southern India the crop is grown during Rabi and summer seasons. \r\nKharif crop should be sown soon after first break of monsoon rains i.e. nearly in last week of June. \r\nTherefore, the best sowing time is in last week of June to first week of July depending upon onset of monsoon. \r\nWhereas rabi jawar is sown in the month of October to November.\r\nb) Spacing:A spacing of 40-45 cm between the rows and 15-20 cm between the plants is quite satisfactory.\r\nc) Seed rate: Required plant population may be obtained by using a seed rate of 8-12 kg/ha. The seeds are sown about 3-4 cm deep in the furrows.\r\n', 'Seed treatment:\r\nThe seed treatment may be done by Agrosan GN, Thiram at the rate of 3g/kg of seed or sulphur at the rate of 5g/kg of seed. The seed is treated, dried and sown in the field.\r\n', 'Application of mannurs and fertilizers:\r\nSorghum is an exhaustive crop and it depletes soil fertility very fast, if proper care is not taken. \r\nThe fertilizer doses differ from type to type and nature of crop to be grown e.g. local varieties need less quantity than hybrid ones.\r\nSimilarly, irrigated crop requires higher doses than rainfed ones no matter whether it is a local or high yielding variety. \r\nConsidering all these points an optimum dose may be found out from the following details:\r\n an optimum dose of nitrogen for rainfed high yielding and local varieties of irrigated crop should be 60-80kg/ha while for irrigated high yielding varieties it should be between 120-150 kg/ha.\r\n In case of heavy soils one single application gives better results than split application but in case of light soils split application\r\n i.e. half basal and remaining half as top-dressing at knee-height stage or 30-35 days after sowing is preferred. \r\nUnder low rainfall or in rainfed areas top-dressing of nitrogen is not required. On an average a dose of 40-60 kg P2O5/ha is found to be good. \r\nPlacement at 4-6 cm depth has given better results. However, under normal conditions it is mostly basal placed. \r\nPotash at the rate of 40kg/ha applied at the time of field preparation gives good result.\r\n', 'Interculture :\r\nManual weedings and hoeings help in solving the weed problem but it is possible only during rabi and arid cropping seasons while rains do not permit the manual weeding \r\nor hoeing during kharif season. \r\nApplication of herbicides like atrazine @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha or Propazine @1.0 kg a.i./ha dissolved in 900-1000 liters of water, therefore, becomes obviously essential to control weeds. \r\nThese herbicides should be applied before emergence of sorghum seedlings.\r\n', 'Irrigation:\r\nSorghum is a fairly drought resistant crop and it does very well in areas receiving 50 cm well distributed rainfall but it cannot withstand waterlogging at any stage of crop growth.\r\n The most critical growth stages for irrigation are knee-height stage, flowering and grain filling stages at which the crop should be ensured for proper moisture conditions \r\nso that the crop does not suffer from moisture stress.\r\nContrary to this in kharif crop an efficient drainage must be provided as the crop cannot tolerate water accumulation for more than few hours, therefore,\r\n in low lying areas sowing of crop on 5-7cm high ridges or sowing in flat beds followed by light earthing is a remedy for stagnant water in the field.\r\n', 'Plant protection Measures:\r\nSorghum is found to be attacked by shoot-fly, stem-borer and midges mainly and they cause a considerable reduction in grain and stover yields. Following schedule may help in their control:\r\nA. Schedule of operations for control for insect/pest in sorghum crop \r\nShoot fly - \r\nChemical to be used: Carbofuran @ 1kg/100kg of seed, or 5% Disulfoton @ 3g/m row length, or 10% phorate grannule @ 5 g/m row length may be sown along with seeds. \r\nOr Spraying of Carbaryl (50%w.p) or Endrin (20% EC @ 2 kg or 1 kg/ha respectively twice i.e. 3-5 DAS & 8-12 DAS.\r\nPreventive: Use of higher seed rate removal & destruction of damaged seedlings 10-12 days after germination.\r\nStem Borer - \r\nChemical to be used: Application of grannules of any of 4% Edosulfan @ 8kg/ha, 4% Carbaryl @ 12kg/ha or 2% Lindane @ 15 kg/ha in leaf whorls \r\ntwice at 10 days interval starting from 20 days after germination.\r\nPreventive: Uprooting and burning of stubbles.\r\nMidge - \r\nChemical to be used: Spraying of Carbaryl (50%W.P) @ 3 kg/ha or Lindane (20EC) @ 1.25 litre or Endosulfan (30 EC) @ 1 litre in 500-600 litres of water/ha \r\nbefore flowering or 3 days after panicle emergence controls the insect.\r\nPreventive: Buming of panicle residues and chaff left after threshing.\r\nB. Disease and their control\r\nGrain smut - \r\nControl Measures: Seed treatment with organo-mercurial compound viz. Ceresan, Agrosan GN, etc.\r\nErgot - \r\n Control Measures:\r\n1. Seed treatment with any of the above-mentioned chemicals.\r\n2. Spraying of Ziram @0.15% or 1 kg/ha at boot leaf stage and its repetition at 5-7 days interval at least two times.\r\n3. Immersion of seed in 2% saline water, washing them with fresh water and drying in shade controls the disease.\r\nDowny midew - \r\n Control Measures:\r\n1. Avoid waterlogging.\r\n2. Removal and burning/burying of diseased plants.\r\n3. Application of Dithane Z-78 @ 0.2 % spray solution reduces secondary infaction.\r\n', 'Harvesting and threshing:\r\na) Harvesting\r\nThe high yielding varieties mature in about 100-120 days duration after which they are harvested. \r\nGenerally two methods of harvesting i.e. either stalk-cut or cutting of earheads by sickles are employed. However, in foreign countries sorghum harvesters are used. \r\nIn case of stock cut method the plants are cut from near the ground level, the stalks are tied into bundles of convenient removed from plants,\r\nwhile in later case the earheads, after their removal from the standing crop, are piled up on the threshing floor and after few days they are threshed. \r\nThreshing of earheds is done either by beating them with sticks or by trampling them under bullock’s feet. \r\nLater method is quicker and is practiced by majority of farmers who use to grow the crop on larger scale.\r\nb) Yield\r\nThe grain yield of improved varieties under assured water supply ranges between 25-35 quintals/ha and that of hay or karvi between 150-170 quintals/ha.\r\nc) Storage\r\nthe harvested grains are sun-dried and storage is conventional.\r\n', NULL, NULL),

In the case of intercropping, sow the seeds of the intercrop in between the paired rows of cotton in a row of 5 cm apart and cover the seeds.\r\n• Sow the required number of seeds in each hole.\r\n', 'WEED MANAGEMENT\r\n• Apply Pendimethalin @ 3.3 l/ha  three days after sowing, using a hand operated sprayer fitted with deflecting or fan type nozzle. Sufficient moisture should be present in the soil at the time of herbicide application.  This will ensure weed free condition upto 40 days.\r\n• One hand weeding on 45 DAS will keep weed free environment upto 60 DAS.\r\n• Hoe and hand weed between 18th to 20th day of sowing, if herbicide is not applied at the time of sowing.\r\n', 'GAP FILLING\r\n\r\nTake up gap filling on the 10th day of sowing.\r\n• In the case of TCHB 213, raise seedlings in polythene bags of size 15  x 10 cm.\r\n• Fill the polythene bags with a mixture of FYM and soil in the ratio of 1:3.\r\n• Dibble one seed per bag on the same day when sowing is taken up in the field.\r\n• Pot water and maintain.\r\n• On the 10th day of sowing, plant seedlings maintained in the polythene bags, one in each of the gaps in the field by cutting open the polythene bag and planting the seedling along with the soil intact and then pot water.\r\n', 'IRRIGATION\r\nSkip furrow irrigation\r\n1. Suited to heavy soils like clay and loam\r\n2. Alternate furrows should be skipped and may be converted to ridges having a wide bed formation.\r\n3. Short term crops like pulses may be raised in wider bed without exclusive irrigation.\r\n4. Water saving is 50% when compared to control.\r\n', 'HARVESTING\r\n1. Harvest at frequent intervals, at less than 7 days interval.\r\n2. Harvest in the morning hours upto 10 to 11 a.m only when there is moisture so that dry leaves and bracts do not stick to the kapas and lower the market value.\r\n3. Pick kapas from well burst bolls only.\r\n4. Remove only the kapas from the bolls and leave the bracts on the plants.\r\n5. After kapas is picked, sort out good puffy ones and keep separately.\r\n6. Keep stained, discoloured and insect attacked kapas separately.\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL),
(11, 'Rice', 'SEED SELECTION\r\nProper seed selection based on the cultivation environment is the first step towards ensuring that the highest possible yield is achieved.\r\nSelecting good quality seed has many advantages and will help to;\r\n• Improve yield by 5 – 20%\r\n• Improve germination by more than 80%\r\n• Increase resistance to disease and pest attacks\r\n• Maintain uniformity in plant size\r\n• Have fewer weed problems\r\n', 'LAND PREPARATION\r\nThe main purpose of land preparation is to have the soil in optimum physical condition for growing rice. Plowing and tilling of land is done to predetermined levels that allow rice plants to develop a good root system.\r\nThe proper preparation of land for sowing is achieved via tractors (mechanical means) or with the help of water buffaloes. Land preparation also includes land leveling to ensure water reaches all areas planted.\r\n', 'CROP ESTABLISHMENT\r\nTransplanting\r\nTransplanting is the more popular plant establishment technique in Sri Lanka and much of Asia. Transplanting occurs when pre-germinated seedlings are transferred from a seedbed to the wet field. It requires less seed and is an effective method for controlling weeds. A disadvantage is that the practice of transplanting is more labor intensive.\r\nPrior to transplanting, seedlings are established in a separate nursery area. They grow between 20 and 80 days before being transplanted to the field. Seedlings can be transplanted by either machine or hand.\r\nDirect seeding\r\nDirect seeding is when dry seed or pre-germinated seeds and seedlings are sown by hand or planted by machine.\r\n', 'WATER MANAGEMENT\r\nCultivated rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages and when the soil water content drops below saturation, most rice varieties develop symptoms of water stress. Good water management practices are needed to keep usage at optimum levels and to maximize rice yield.\r\nPre-planting steps that help with water management include;\r\n \r\n• Proper creation and maintenance of field channels for water delivery\r\n• Land levelling that allows water to be evenly distributed and retained\r\n• Tilling operations that include rice field bund preparation, water puddling and maintenance\r\n', 'Manures and Fertilizers in Rice Cultivation:\r\nAs rice crop responds very well to manure and chemicals, it is essential to fo for proper manures and fertilizers in paddy cultivation.\r\n• Farm yard manure/Compost: 10 to 15 cartloads.\r\n• Nitrogen: 100 to 150 Kg/Ha.\r\n• Phosphorous: 50 to 60 Kg P2O5/Ha.\r\n• Potash: 40 to 50 Kg KO/Ha.\r\n• Zinc Sulphate: 25 Kg/Ha.\r\n• Green Manuring Crops: Sanai, Dhaincha and Moong/Urad.\r\n', 'Harvesting:\r\nHarvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop (rice paddy or rough rice) from the field. Depending on the variety, a rice crop usually reaches maturity at around 115-120 days after crop establishment.\r\nHarvesting activity includes cutting, stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Good harvesting methods help maximize grain yield and minimize grain damage and deterioration.\r\nManual harvesting is very effective when a crop has fallen over. However, it is labour intensive. Manual harvesting usually requires 40 to 80 man-hours per hectare and it takes additional labour to manually collect and haul the harvested crop.\r\nMechanical harvesting using reapers or combine harvesters is the other option, but is not so common due to the availability and cost of machinery.\r\nAfter cutting, the rice must be threshed to separate the grain from the stalk and cleaned. Threshing can be done by hand or machine.\r\n\r\nYield\r\nTotal yield can vary depending on various factors such as chosen variety, soil type, cultivation method, farm management practices etc. On average, with modern improved varieties, you can expect about 1500 to 2000 kg per acre.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
